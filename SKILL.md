description: Persistent Python runtime for AI agents. Use when the agent needs to keep variables, imports, connections, sockets, threads, servers, or analysis state alive across turns. Send code through pysh run/fire/fork/poll. Attach a human REPL. Operate local or remote pythond daemon sessions.

# pythond

Persistent Python with a function-call API. Code in, result out.

```bash
pysh run work "x = 42"   # sets x
pysh run work "x + 1"    # 43 (x survived)
```

Variables, connections, threads persist between calls.
No terminal parsing. No ANSI. exec() semantics.

`pysh` is your function-call surface into that persistent process: source code
in, captured output out. Do not treat it as a terminal transcript.

## Mental Model

One named session is one Python child process with one persistent namespace.

Your cells run through Python `eval`/`exec`. Human attach connects to the same
namespace. You and the human are operating the same live runtime.

## Default Work Surface

Use the live session as the default work surface. Once a daemon/session exists,
run task logic through `pysh run`, `pysh fire`, or `pysh fork`. The cell is
Python, so host checks such as `ls`, `pwd`, and `git status` should run through
`subprocess.run(...)` inside the session when their result belongs to the task.

The host shell is plumbing for starting the daemon, writing Python files to disk
before loading them, and package management (`pip install`). Everything else goes
through the session so cwd, env, imports, sockets, variables, and visible history
stay together.

Keep state in the Python namespace when you will need it again:

- parsed data, config, DataFrames, compiled regexes, imported modules,
- database handles, HTTP sessions, WebSockets, sockets, SSH tunnels,
- local servers, file watchers, background daemon threads,
- live decisions such as blocked IPs, feature flags, rate limits, and routing
  weights.

Do not reopen or recompute these on every turn unless the task requires a fresh
state. Read, patch, and inspect them by name in later cells.

Run host commands from inside the session when their output is part of the task:

```python
import subprocess
subprocess.run(["git", "status"], capture_output=True, text=True)
```

## Bootstrap

```bash
pythond daemon          # start daemon (foreground)
pysh new work           # create a persistent session
```

If daemon is not running, start it first. One daemon manages all sessions.
Each session is an isolated subprocess with its own namespace.

`pyctl start` calls the same daemon entry point as `pythond daemon`. Prefer
`pythond daemon` in agent instructions; `pyctl` is mainly the daemon-management
surface for humans and remote proxy setup.

## Core Commands

```bash
pysh new <name>              # create a persistent session
pysh run <name> "code"       # sync exec/eval, raw output
pysh fire <name> "code"      # async thread, shared namespace
pysh fork <name> "code"      # async process, POSIX only, killable
pysh poll <name> [cell_id]   # read async result
pysh attach <name>           # human REPL, Ctrl-] detaches
pysh int <name>              # fire=best effort, fork=kill
pysh kill <name>             # terminate session
pysh ls                      # list sessions
pysh status <name>           # JSON health
pysh vars <name>             # JSON namespace names
pysh complete <name> "text"  # JSON completion candidates
```

Session names are canonical lowercase: `a-z`, `0-9`, `_`, or `-`, 1-80
characters. Names with uppercase letters or dots are rejected. Windows device
names such as `con`, `nul`, `prn`, `aux`, `com1`, and `lpt1` are also rejected.

## run, fire, fork

Use `run` for short operations and direct inspection.

```bash
pysh run work "import sqlite3; db = sqlite3.connect('app.db')"
pysh run work "db.execute('select count(*) from users').fetchone()"
```

Use `fire` for slow work that must share the live namespace.

```bash
pysh fire work "model = train(X, y)"
pysh poll work <cell_id>
pysh run work "model.score(X_test)"   # model is there
```

Use `fork` for slow or risky work that should be killable. It runs in a child
process and pickles new or reassigned variables back into the parent namespace.
Unpicklable objects (sockets, locks, CUDA tensors) are skipped. In-place
mutations (`list.append`, `dict[k]=v`) won't merge -- use assignment
(`x = new_value`). Failed forks do not merge.

```bash
pysh fork work "results = expensive_search(params)"
pysh poll work <cell_id>
pysh int work                # kills fork'd process
```

`fire` cells in one session run serially under the session lock. Use multiple
sessions for real parallelism.

## State Persists

Variables set in one `run` call are available in the next:

```bash
pysh run work "import pandas as pd; df = pd.read_csv('big.csv')"
pysh run work "len(df)"       # 1000000  (df still in memory)
pysh run work "df.describe()" # summary  (no re-read needed)
```

Connections, threads, servers -- anything in the namespace -- stay alive:

```bash
pysh run work "import sqlite3; db = sqlite3.connect('app.db')"
# ... 100 turns later ...
pysh run work "db.execute('SELECT count(*) FROM users').fetchone()"
# (42,)   (same connection, never closed)
```

## File Loading

For code with quotes, f-strings, SQL, or more than a small expression, write a
file and load it into the session:

```bash
cat > /tmp/pythond_task.py << 'EOF'
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv("data.csv")
print(f"rows={len(df)} cols={list(df.columns)}")
EOF
pysh run work "exec(open('/tmp/pythond_task.py').read())"
```

The file is transport. The namespace is the workspace.

## Output Formats

| Command | Output |
|---------|--------|
| `run` | raw captured text |
| `fire` | JSON `{"cell_id": "...", "status": "fired"}` |
| `fork` | JSON `{"cell_id": "...", "status": "forked"}` |
| `poll` | JSON cell result |
| `status` | JSON session health |
| `vars` | JSON namespace names |
| `ls` | text listing |
| `new`, `kill`, `int` | text confirmation or error |

Errors in `run` return traceback text but do not kill the session.

## Remote Sessions

Remote work has two modes.

Use direct remote env vars when each client command can connect straight to the
remote daemon:

```bash
export PYTHOND_HOST=10.0.0.5:7399 PYTHOND_TOKEN=<token> PYTHOND_TLS=1
pysh run work "code"
```

Use a local proxy daemon when a one-shot shell tool cannot hold the remote
connection. Default to transparent alias mode: the local proxy name is also the
remote session name, so the command shape stays local.

```bash
# Remote TLS uses a self-signed server cert; pin it before connecting.
pyctl pin ~/server_cert.pem
pyctl connect work 10.0.0.5:7399 <token> --tls
pysh run work "code"
pyctl disconnect work
```

Use explicit proxy form only when one proxy should address a different remote
session: `pysh <command> <proxy> <remote-session> "code"`.
Remote proxy examples currently use `run`; do not document remote async until
`fire`/`poll` target-session routing is fully covered.

## Security Model

Treat pythond like SSH into a Python runtime.

- Not a sandbox: code runs with the daemon user's OS permissions.
- Once authenticated, a client has full access to all sessions; there is no
  per-session permission isolation.
- Local POSIX uses an AF_UNIX socket with file permissions.
- Local Windows uses localhost TCP, token auth, and owner-level directory ACLs.
- Remote access uses pinned self-signed TLS plus token auth; mTLS adds client
  cert trust, but the token is still required.
- Daemon access logs are written to runtime `access.log` and mirrored to daemon stderr.
  They include `conn_id`, peer, `cmd`, session, status, and `body_bytes`; they
  do not include token values or Python code bodies.
- Interactive `pysh run/fire/fork` echoes submitted code, errors, and raw `run`
  output to the client terminal's stderr. Treat that as visible operator output.

Runtime files and durable state are separate:

| Purpose | Windows | POSIX |
| --- | --- | --- |
| daemon metadata/logs | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\pythond\daemon.json`, `%LOCALAPPDATA%\pythond\access.log` | `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/pythond/` or `/tmp/pythond-$UID/` |
| session state/certs | `~\.pythond\sessions\...`, `~\.pythond\tls\...` | `~/.pythond/sessions/...`, `~/.pythond/tls/...` |

### TLS cert management

```bash
pyctl cert                     # show/generate this machine's cert
pyctl trust <cert.pem>         # authorize a client (server-side)
pyctl pin <cert.pem>           # verify a server (client-side)
```

`pyctl cert` generates a self-signed cert on first run, then shows the path
on subsequent runs. The output tells you the next step (`pyctl trust` or
`pyctl pin`).

### mTLS plus token

Both sides authenticate each other. Token is still required.

```bash
# client: generate client cert
pyctl cert
# copy client ~/.pythond/tls/cert.pem to server as ~/client_cert.pem

# server: generate server cert, then trust client cert
pyctl cert
# copy server ~/.pythond/tls/cert.pem to client as ~/server_cert.pem
pyctl trust ~/client_cert.pem

# client: pin server cert, then connect
pyctl pin ~/server_cert.pem
pyctl connect server 10.0.0.5:7399 <token> --tls
```

## REPL Patterns

- Import once, then use shorter names in later cells.
- Use expression results directly: `pysh run work "len(items)"`.
- For complex code, write a file and load it with
  `exec(open('/tmp/name.py').read())`.
- For host commands, call `subprocess.run(..., capture_output=True, text=True)`
  inside the session so the output is a string you can parse.
- For hot reload, use `exec(open(...).read())` or `importlib.reload(module)`.
- If a cell fails, fix the function or data and retry in the same namespace.
- Split long workflows into small cells so successful prior state is retained.

## Async Rules

`fire` cells in one session execute serially under the session lock. Use
multiple sessions for parallel execution.

`pysh poll <session> <cell_id>` reads a specific cell.
`pysh poll <session>` reads the most recent cell, or `{"status":"idle"}` if
none exist.

`fork` cells run in a child process. New/changed variables are pickled back
and merged when done. Unpicklable objects (sockets, locks, CUDA tensors) are
skipped. In-place mutations (`list.append`, `dict[k]=v`) won't merge -- use
assignment (`x = new_value`). Failed forks do not merge. Merge is
last-writer-wins: a finished fork can overwrite a variable that the parent
changed while the fork was running.

## Checkpoints

Successful synchronous `run` cells are appended to
`~/.pythond/sessions/<name>/history.py`. Successful async `fire`/`fork` cells
are appended when `poll` observes completion. If a session dies, replay:
`pysh run <name> "exec(open(...).read())"`.

Like shell history and environment variables under SSH, pythond session history,
logs, and live namespaces can expose secrets. `history.py` and `session.log` may
contain executed Python source and captured output. Variables assigned in a
session remain in that live Python process until overwritten or the session is
killed. Do not paste API keys, passwords, tokens, or other secrets into cells
unless you are willing for them to persist in that session and its local files.

## Protocol Notes

WebSocket text frames. First line = command + args. After first `\n` = code body.

```text
run work
print("hello")
```

Transport: `ws://` (local), `wss://` (remote TLS).

## Avoid

- Do not parse ANSI escape sequences; output is already clean text.
- Do not use `pysh` as a terminal transcript.
- Do not put Python source inside JSON; send source as the protocol body or load
  it from a file.
- Do not move task state back into the host shell once a session exists.
- Do not manage daemon WebSocket lifetimes manually. The CLI may use short
  connections; remote proxy connections are held by the daemon.
